# Results Screen Implementation

## Overview
The Results Screen displays processed images in a masonry/grid layout with support for:
- Lazy loading of image thumbnails with async animations
- Full-screen image detail view with pinch-to-zoom
- Share functionality via `UIActivityViewController`
- "Start Over" button to reset the app state

## Components

### 1. ResultsGridView
Main view that displays the grid of processed images.

**Features:**
- Adaptive grid layout using `LazyVGrid`
- Loading state with progress indicator
- Error state with retry functionality
- Empty state
- Floating "Start Over" button with gradient background

### 2. ResultThumbnailView
Individual thumbnail in the grid.

**Features:**
- Lazy loading animation (staggered based on index)
- Scale animation on tap
- Shadow and rounded corners
- Placeholder while loading

### 3. ImageDetailView
Full-screen image viewer presented as a sheet.

**Features:**
- Pinch-to-zoom gesture (1x to 4x)
- Pan gesture when zoomed
- Double-tap to toggle zoom
- Navigation bar with Close and Share buttons
- Black background for focus

### 4. ShareSheet
UIKit integration for sharing images.

**Implementation:**
- Uses `UIActivityViewController`
- Supports sharing to Photos, Messages, Mail, etc.
- Native iOS share sheet UI

## Navigation Flow

1. **Upload Screen** → User uploads images
2. **Processing Screen** → Images are processed
3. **Results Screen** → Processed images displayed in grid
4. **Detail View** → Tap image to view full-screen
5. **Share Sheet** → Share button in detail view
6. **Start Over** → Returns to Upload Screen

## Integration

### With Existing App State
```swift
// Results are fetched from resultUrls in AppState
resultVM.downloadResults(from: resultVM.resultUrls)

// Start Over clears AppState
appState.reset()
resultVM.clearResults()
```

### Navigation
The app uses notification-based navigation:
```swift
NotificationCenter.default.post(name: .navigateToUpload, object: nil)
```

## Testing

Run `ResultsTestApp.swift` to see the Results Screen with sample data:
```bash
# In Xcode, set ResultsTestApp as the active scheme and run
```

## Customization

### Grid Layout
Adjust the grid columns by modifying:
```swift
@State private var gridColumns = [GridItem(.adaptive(minimum: 120), spacing: 16)]
```

### Animation Timing
Modify the staggered loading animation:
```swift
DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + Double(index) * 0.1)
```

### Colors & Styling
All colors use the `TonaTheme`:
- Primary: `TonaTheme.primaryColor`
- Background: `TonaTheme.backgroundColor`
- Danger: `TonaTheme.dangerColor`
- Shadows: `TonaTheme.cardShadowColor`
